# Investigating the Genetic Foundations of Body Size Evolution in African Cichlid fishes

This repository provides a complete pipeline for analyzing sequence data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and performing Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). It guides users through downloading sequence data, mapping reads to a reference genome, variant calling, and conducting GWAS analysis using PLINK. Additionally, it includes a script for visualizing GWAS results with a Manhattan plot. The pipeline is designed for HPC environments and utilizes SLURM for job submission.
